    "# COMPOSITIONAL SEMANTICS RESULTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we compare the the original audio features with the audio features predicted by the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once video features were mapped onto audio features, an experiment was performed in order to verify if the model developed the ability of combine elements autonomously, i.e. if it developed compositional semantics capabilities. In order to do that, five subsequent tests were performed, one for each object: pen, phone, spoon, knife and fork. For each of them, a reduced dataset was prepared, removing the videos that showed the object moving to the left, to the right, up, down and rotating. The model was trained on the reduced dataset, resulting in 13,050 samples, and then tested against the 1,450 videos that had been removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results are shown in table 12 at page 27 on https://github.com/fabiodeponte/symbol_grounding/blob/main/grounding_words_visual_perceptions.pdf.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was able to generalize when similar videos were present during training. However, it was not able to combine information from the videos that showed the objects staying still and information about the movement applied to other objects, to form a sentence composed by “move” and the name of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when videos showing pens moving to the left were part of the training set, the model was able to recognize new videos showing a similar scene. On the contrary, when videos showing pens moving to the left were NOT part of the training set at all, the model was not able to recognize new videos showing that scene, even if it was exposed to videos showing still pens and spoons moving to the left. The (failed) attempt was to let the model compose separate information from different videos and let it apply to a single one.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: for the sake of clarity, we show here only the first 100 utterances. In the folder https://github.com/fabiodeponte/symbol_grounding/tree/main/seq2seq%20chollet/compositional%20semantics%20-%20complete%20tests the predicted utterance for each of the 1,450 tested videos can be found."
